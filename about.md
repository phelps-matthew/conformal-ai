Hi there, I'm Matthew. Welcome to Conformal.ai. 

### What does conformal mean?
A conformal transformation is a mathematical transformation that deals with scaling the properties of space. Roughly speaking, they are special scale transformations that stretch, bend, and compactify space.

### What is Conformal.ai?
A personal site hosting content that aims to cover information of many scales – tech, data, math, physics, and the future.

### Tell me more about this "Matthew" human...

#### Background
After finishing [my PhD](https://github.com/phelps-matthew/Cosmological-Perturbations) in gravitation and cosmology, I moved deeper into the world of machine learning, with a special focus on improving the flow of data and algorithms (i.e. ML ops and data engineering). I am hopeful that the things I work on will have a positive influence on the evolution of humanity.
